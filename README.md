# A simple JSON formatter and validator that does simple highlighting using JavaScript.

As part of the [10k Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com) I built this simple JSON formatter/validator with initial payload less than 10kb. The page works even without JavaScript by formatting the JSON on server side.

### Demo: http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/json-formatter/

## Features:
* Under 10kb of initial payload
* Follows web accessibility guidelines
* Works with older browsers (IE9+)
* Works without JavaScript
